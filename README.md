# StorageVillage

## Overview

StorageVillage is a personal quality-of-life mod for **Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord**. It adds several helper features to make gameplay smoother as a RPG player.

## Features

### Inventory

A storage that player can access while visiting the settlements. Player can store items in the storage and retrieve them in the next town. It's kinda a common RPG feature.

### Troops Management

Another storage that player can access while visiting the settlements but it's for troops/prisoners instead. Troops/prisoners in the storage does not consume food or require salary. So player can build the army without worrying about the recurring payment.

### Bank

I really love the bank feature from Mount & Blade: With Fire & Sword. Thus I brought it back to the Bannerlord. Deposit your money in the bank and earn weekly salary as passive income.

### Bandit Management

This feature can set the goal of the bandit units on the map. Player can select the bandit target to certain characters / settlement so the bandit will try to engage the character or patrol around the settlement. It can be helpful when farming bandits for experience and money.

### Compatibility

Personally tested v1.2.12.77991 build. Everything should works fine.

### Development

Build the debug / release dll using `dotnet build -c {Debug or Release}`.
